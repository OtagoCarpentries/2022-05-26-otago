<h3 id="r-and-rstudio">R and RStudio</h3>

<ul>
  <li>R and RStudio are separate downloads and installations. R is the
underlying statistical computing environment, but using R alone is no
fun. RStudio is a graphical integrated development environment (IDE) that makes
using R much easier and more interactive. You need to install R before you
install RStudio. After installing both programs, you will need to install 
some specific R packages within RStudio. Follow the instructions below for
your operating system, and then follow the instructions to install
<strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tidyverse</code></strong></li>
</ul>

  <h2 id="if-you-already-have-r-and-rstudio-installed">If you already have R and RStudio installed</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Open RStudio, and click on “Help” &gt; “Check for updates”. If a new version is
available, quit RStudio, and download the latest version for RStudio.</li>
    <li>
      <p>To check which version of R you are using, start RStudio and the first thing
 that appears in the console indicates the version of R you are
 running. Alternatively, you can type <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sessionInfo()</code>, which will also display
 which version of R you are running. Go on
 the <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/">CRAN website</a> and check
whether a more recent version is available. If so, please download and install
it. You can <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/rw-FAQ.html#How-do-I-UNinstall-R_003f">check here</a> for
more information on how to remove old versions from your system if you wish to do so.</p>

<h4 id="linux">Linux</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Follow the instructions for your distribution
 from <a href="https://cloud.r-project.org/bin/linux">CRAN</a>, they provide information
 to get the most recent version of R for common distributions. For most
 distributions, you could use your package manager (e.g., for Debian/Ubuntu run
 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo apt-get install r-base</code>, and for Fedora <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo yum install R</code>), but we
 don’t recommend this approach as the versions provided by this are
 usually out of date. In any case, make sure you have at least R 3.5.1.</li>
  <li>Go to the <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download">RStudio download
page</a></li>
  <li>Under <em>Installers</em> select the version that matches your distribution, and
 install it with your preferred method (e.g., with Debian/Ubuntu <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sudo dpkg -i
 rstudio-x.yy.zzz-amd64.deb</code> at the terminal).</li>
  <li>Once it’s installed, open RStudio to make sure it works and you don’t get any
 error messages.</li>
  <li>Follow the steps in the <a href="#for-everyone">instructions for everyone</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="for-everyone">For everyone</h4>

<ul>
  <li>After installing R and RStudio, you need to install the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">tidyverse</code> package. Start RStudio by double-clicking the icon and then type:
<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">install.packages("tidyverse")</code>. You can also do this by going to Tools -&gt; Install Packages and 
typing the names of the packages you want to install, separated by a comma.</li>
